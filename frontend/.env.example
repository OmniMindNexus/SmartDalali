# Frontend environment variables
# Set this to your backend API base URL (including /api suffix if your backend uses it).
# For local development it's recommended to use a relative path so Vite's dev
# server proxy forwards requests to the backend and avoids CORS:
#
# VITE_API_URL=/api
#
# If you want to call the backend directly (not recommended during dev),
# set it to the full URL, e.g.:
VITE_API_URL=/api

# Supabase - set these from your Supabase project settings
# For local development put these values in a .env file (never commit real keys)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-public-anon-key
